problem: |
  Brentwood’s IT team juggled **400+ monthly tickets** across 30+ disparate systems (Meraki, Blackbaud,
  JAMF, AD), leading to slow response times and manual overnight backups.

solution: |
  * **GPT-4 Help-desk** — Vector-indexed SOPs let the bot auto-resolve 80 % of student+staff questions,
    cutting median response time from 45 min → 3 min.
  * **Python/Bash backup suite** — Migrated cron-based MySQL dumps to Azure Functions + Blob Storage
    with retention policies.
  * **Meraki bulk ops** — Scripts label & VLAN-tag 30 new APs in < 90 s via the REST API.
  * **Observability** — Prometheus exporters + Loki log shipping; Grafana alerting to Teams.
