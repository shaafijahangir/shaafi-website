## 👋 Context

Short-form video platforms like TikTok and YouTube Shorts are filled with AI-enhanced content — from motivational quotes to historical facts and lifestyle visuals. I wanted to explore how far I could take automation by designing a system that:

- Pulls content ideas from a spreadsheet
- Turns them into videos using **JSON2Video**
- Posts them directly to **TikTok and YouTube Shorts**

This project combined creativity, technical orchestration, and lean tooling to create a **zero-touch video engine**.

---

## 💡 The Problem

Creating and posting content at scale takes time — writing, editing, voiceovers, uploading, and tracking. This workflow quickly becomes unsustainable, especially for solo creators.

On top of that, platforms like JSON2Video use a **credit-based system**:

- **1 image = 1 credit**
- **1 second of video = 3 credits**
- You start with **500–600 free credits**, which gives you about **8 minutes** of video generation before needing to pay

This makes efficiency critical when testing ideas at scale.

## ⚙️ Implementation / How It Works

### 🧾 Step 1: Content Planning (Google Sheets)

All content ideas — quotes, captions, voice settings — are entered into a spreadsheet. This acts as the **source of truth** and controls which ideas are rendered and posted.

### 🎬 Step 2: JSON2Video Template Creation

Using a vertical 1080×1920 layout, I built a reel template where:

- A **background image** is generated from a prompt
- The quote is read aloud using AI voice (Brian)
- A subtitle is **centered for maximum engagement**

### 🤖 Step 3: Make.com Automation & Posting

- **Make.com** watches the sheet and passes new rows to JSON2Video
- The rendered video is then **auto-posted** to:
  - **YouTube Shorts** via API
  - **TikTok Business** via HTTP request
- The sheet is updated from `To do` → `Done`

**🧑‍💻 My Role:**  
I architected the full automation — from data structuring to JSON template logic, Make.com flows, and API routing. I also optimized for credit efficiency and made it easy to plug in new content ideas for batch publishing.

---

## 📌 Impact

- Created 30+ short-form videos with no manual editing
- Built a base pipeline that can scale with new content types (e.g., viral facts, memes)
- Tested real-time content creation efficiency and ROI of tools like JSON2Video

**Limitations/Insights:**

- Each video consumes valuable credits (3 per second), so optimizing length is key
- Tools like JSON2Video and Make.com are flexible but require strict JSON formatting
- Posting to TikTok requires a verified developer account

## 💭 Why I Built This

I wanted to prove that **content creation at scale doesn’t need to be overwhelming**. This project is my version of a creator’s production studio — automated, idea-driven, and creatively free.

It also pushed me to think like a product builder: how can I minimize friction, costs, and time while maximizing reach?

## 🚀 What’s Next

- 🔄 Switch to **Airtable** for better data management and filtering
- 🔑 Complete **TikTok Developer** account setup for full API automation
- 🎞️ Integrate **Opus Clip** to convert YouTube videos into viral highlights — and pipe those directly into JSON2Video
- 💡 Auto-generate new quotes using **GPT** and pre-schedule them weekly
- 📊 Build an analytics layer to monitor views, retention, and watch time
