## 👋 Context

In 2019, I worked with the **Bangkok School of Management (BSM)** to completely redesign their public-facing website — and later helped deliver an HR analytics training session for their Strategic HRM programme.

The website at the time felt overwhelming: walls of text, low visual contrast, and confusing navigation. I stepped in to modernize the experience — and soon after, BSM invited me to go one step further.

## 🖥️ Website Redesign: From Bulky to Beautiful

My redesign focused on improving user experience, readability, and visual structure.

### 🛠 Highlights:

- Clean layout with proper spacing and font hierarchy
- Simplified and reorganized navigation bar
- Added modern buttons with **3D-style hover effects**
- Replaced long paragraphs with visual content blocks
- Brought **color and clarity** to every section

### 🔄 Before vs After

### **Before – Cluttered, Text-Heavy Layout**

## 🎓 Live HR Analytics Training

As part of BSM’s workshop series, I delivered a **4-hour remote training** for **12 SMB employees** across Asia on building an **HR analytics dashboard in Excel**.

I created a clean, interactive template (see PDF below) and led a live webinar where I shared my screen and guided participants through exercises — from pivot tables to charting real people data.

## 📊 Strategic HRM Dashboard – Excel & Google Sheets

The dashboard was built in **Excel and Google Sheets** with a focus on clarity and usability — helping HR teams explore their data and spot trends visually.

### ✅ Features:

- Interactive charts, KPIs, and filters
- Pivot tables for demographics, payroll, and attendance
- Clear tab/index design
- Salary breakdowns, training logs, ratings, and more

## 📄 Slide Deck

Here’s the presentation used in the session. Scroll through the slides to see the structure and hands-on examples:

## ✨ What I Took Away

This project showed me that clear design and effective teaching go hand-in-hand.

It wasn’t just about fixing a website or making spreadsheets look good — it was about building tools people can actually use, and **teaching them how** in a way that’s approachable and empowering.

---

## 🧠 Lessons Learned

- Real-world design is about removing friction, not adding features
- Spreadsheets can be powerful analytics tools when structured well
- Teaching is most effective when the audience is hands-on and engaged
