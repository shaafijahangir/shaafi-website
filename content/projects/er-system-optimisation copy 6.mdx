problem: |
  BC emergency rooms rely on manual **Injury Severity Score (ISS)** combined with nurse intuition,
  causing inconsistent wait-times and equity gaps for under-represented groups.

solution: |
  1. **Data pipeline** — Ingested anonymised 35 000-visit dataset; engineered 27 features incl. comorbidities.
  2. **Gradient-boosted model** — Improves critical-case recall by **+18 pp** over ISS baseline.
  3. **Interactive dashboard** — Real-time bed allocation suggestions, colour-coded risk heat-map.
