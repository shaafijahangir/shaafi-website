## 👋 Context

When we joined Island Health’s Code Hack 2023, our goal was simple: improve the way emergency rooms serve people in pain.

ERs across Canada often run on a **first-come, first-served** basis — which doesn’t always make sense. Imagine someone walking in with a **broken leg**, only to wait behind someone with a **minor scratch** just because they arrived a few minutes later.

**Priority Health** was our response — a smarter, fairer triage system that lets medical staff prioritize patients based on **real risk**, not arrival time.

---

## 💡 The Problem

Emergency rooms in Canada can see **wait times of 8 hours or more**, especially in busy urban hospitals. During that time, patients with serious conditions might go unnoticed while others with less critical needs are seen first.

We realized this wasn’t just a logistics problem — it was a **data problem**. Traditional intake is manual, and triage often happens after patients arrive. There's no intelligent way to estimate risk **before** someone even steps inside the ER.

---

## 💭 The Idea

We built a system that uses a medically-informed scoring model — based on the **Injury Severity Score (ISS)** — to quickly estimate how serious a patient's situation is.

Patients fill out a digital form before arriving at the hospital. From there, a **Patient Metric Score** (from 0 to 10) is automatically generated. Higher scores indicate more urgent cases.

This score can help hospital staff prioritize care more effectively — so those who need help **right now** get it right away.

And we didn’t stop there. In future versions, we want to pull in **past medical history** to better understand how recurring or chronic conditions might impact risk. For example, shortness of breath may be much more serious in a patient with a history of heart disease.

## ⚙️ How It Works: Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### 🏠 Step 1: Public Landing Page

Users land on a welcoming homepage prompting them to register.

---

### 📝 Step 2: Patient Intake Form

They fill out a comprehensive intake form, providing:

- Personal information
- Medical history (chronic pain, prescriptions, mental health)
- Drug/alcohol use
- ADLs (Activities of Daily Living)

### 🔐 Step 3: Admin or Staff Login

Authorized hospital staff log in through a secure portal to view and manage incoming patient submissions.

### 📊 Step 4: Risk Score Result

After submission, the system calculates a **Patient Metric Score** (0–10) based on the user’s input and the ISS model.

This score helps staff triage more efficiently, even before the patient physically enters the waiting room.

## 📌 Why This Matters

We wanted this project to be more than just a demo. So we rooted it in **real-world medical standards**, like the Injury Severity Score (ISS) and informed it with tools used by hospitals across BC and Canada.

Systems like the **Canadian Triage and Acuity Scale (CTAS)** already exist in emergency care. Our goal was to bring those concepts forward into a more **digital-first**, proactive format — one that could eventually plug into electronic medical records and support **automated pre-triage**.

Imagine a world where hospitals can **predict who needs care first**, long before the patient even walks through the door.

## 🌐 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React
- **Backend:** Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Deployment:** Render

## 🧠 Lessons Learned

- User experience must balance **sensitivity** and **clarity** — medical questions can be deeply personal
- Scoring logic must be **fair**, **transparent**, and **backed by evidence**
- Building for healthcare means thinking beyond the screen — it’s about **trust** and **impact**

## 🔍 What’s Next

- FHIR integration to pull in EMR data
- OAuth login for verified hospital staff
- Smarter queueing system using historical triage data
- Multilingual support and accessibility enhancements

## 🚑 Final Thoughts

**Priority Health** was more than a hackathon project — it was a real attempt to rethink how we help people during their most vulnerable moments.

By shifting from guesswork to data, and from manual intake to smart triage, we believe digital systems like this can **reduce ER wait times**, **prioritize urgent care**, and **restore fairness** to a process that affects everyone.
