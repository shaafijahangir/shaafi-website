## 👋 Context

Priority Health is a patient-first triage system designed during Island Health’s Code Hack 2023. It aims to reduce emergency room wait times by prioritizing patients based on a medically informed risk score — not just arrival time.

---

## 💡 The Problem

ER wait times across Canada can exceed **8 hours** — particularly in urban areas. Many patients with serious but “invisible” symptoms wait too long because triage isn’t automated or data-driven.

## ⚙️ How It Works: Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### 🏠 Step 1: Public Landing Page

Users land on a welcoming homepage prompting them to register.

### 📝 Step 2: Patient Intake Form

They fill out a comprehensive intake form, providing:

- Personal information
- Medical history (chronic pain, prescription use, mental health)
- Drug/alcohol usage
- ADLs (Activities of Daily Living)

### 🔐 Step 3: Admin or Staff Login

Authorized hospital staff can log in through a secure portal to manage patient submissions.

### 📊 Step 4: Risk Score Result

Once submitted, the system generates a **Patient Metric Score** between 0–10 (based on the ISS model) and displays it to the user.

This score allows hospital staff to better triage patients **before** they enter the queue physically.
