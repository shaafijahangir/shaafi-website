## üß≠ Overview

Rising Sun is a family-run tourism company that‚Äôs been around for 35+ years. They never had a real online presence, so I helped them build one from scratch using React and TypeScript (on Lovable).

Goal: showcase their experience, offer curated travel packages, and let users book a 10-min consultation call with the founder.

---

## ‚ú® A Legacy Worth Sharing

Rising Sun is more than a tourism company ‚Äî it‚Äôs a story of family, dedication, and a love for sharing Thai culture with the world. Founded in 1988 by Md Salim Jahangir, this full-service tourism agency has guided over 10,000 travelers across Thailand, from Bangkok to the islands.

For 35+ years, the company ran entirely through word of mouth, referrals, and personal relationships. But with the shift in traveler behavior and rising demand for online planning, it was time for a digital transformation.

We set out to build a clean, professional site that tells their story and enables travelers to connect, explore offerings, and book personalized trips ‚Äî all in one place.

![Landing Page](/images/rising-sun-website/landing-page.png)

- Clean homepage with bold call-to-action and scenic hero imagery
- Mobile-friendly layout using Tailwind-style utility classes (via Lovable)
- Navigation to Services, Packages, About, and Testimonials

## üåê What the Website Offers

The Rising Sun site is divided into clear, easy-to-navigate sections that guide the user through their journey. Each section brings personality and function.

![Service Details](/images/rising-sun-website/travel-package.png)

- Services section covering flight booking, hotels, custom itineraries, etc.
- Interactive travel package cards with pricing and details
- CTA buttons to book or customize trips

## üß≠ The Story and the Stats

To build trust and highlight the company's rich history, we crafted a visual timeline and "About" section. This portion shares the journey from humble beginnings in Bangkok to international recognition and now ‚Äî their digital expansion.

![Story & Timeline](/images/rising-sun-website/background.png)

- About section with company history and visual milestone timeline
- Stats like 10k+ travelers, 100% satisfaction, 35+ years experience
- Focused on building trust with visitors

---

## ‚ù§Ô∏è Testimonials & Human Connection

The heart of Rising Sun lies in the people ‚Äî both the family behind it and the travelers they serve. We wanted the site to reflect that.

![Testimonials + Booking CTA](/images/rising-sun-website/cta.png)

- Testimonials slider for social proof
- Final section with a lead capture form
- **Calendly CTA** lets visitors schedule a free 10-minute consultation with the managing director

### üõ† Feature Highlight: Personalized Travel Call

At the bottom of the site, we built a standout section encouraging users to book a **free 10-minute consultation**. With one click, they‚Äôre redirected to **Calendly**, where they can schedule a call with the founder, Md Salim Jahangir.

During this brief call, the Rising Sun team will:

- Learn about your dream destinations in Thailand
- Understand your travel preferences and interests
- Review your budget and timeline
- Offer suggestions or edits to your custom itinerary
- Confirm bookings or next steps, all in one call

This feature turns a passive website visitor into an engaged potential client, creating a human connection right before the trip even begins.
