## 👋 Context

I built this tool to help UVic students (including myself) navigate course planning more intelligently. Traditional systems are fragmented, outdated, and lack personalization — so I designed an end-to-end planner powered by FastAPI, Cohere, and a clean React UI.

The result: a chatbot-guided experience that suggests real courses based on your academic path, interests, and co-op plans.

## 💡 The Problem

- UVic’s existing tools don’t offer personalized course guidance.
- Students often miss prerequisites or pick inefficient course combinations.
- Academic advising is slow and generic — not tailored to your year, major, or graduation track.

## ⚙️ The Solution

- **🏠 Landing Page**  
  Welcomes users with a clear CTA and value props.

  />

- **🧾 Academic Form**  
  Collects your program details: major, year, electives, minor, co-op progress, and more.

- **✅ Course Selector**  
  Filters available courses by your program and tracks selected ones live.

- **🤖 AI Chat Assistant**  
  A Cohere-powered chatbot that responds to queries like:
  - “Give me 6 courses for next term — 3 core and 3 electives.”
  - “What should I take if I want to go into AI?”
