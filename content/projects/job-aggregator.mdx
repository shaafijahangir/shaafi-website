excerpt: "Scrapes multiple job boards, de-duplicates listings, and auto-generates tailored résumés & cover letters."

problem: |
  Job seekers waste **hours copy-pasting** their profile into different ATS portals and manually tweaking
  résumés for each position.  
  Re-entering the same data leads to frustration and prevents deep interview prep.

solution: |
  * **Headless scraping & enrichment** — Playwright crawls Indeed, LinkedIn, and 4 other boards hourly,
    normalising postings into a single SQLite DB.
  * **AI résumé writer** — LangChain + OpenAI fine-tuned prompt maps posting → personalised résumé section.
  * **One-click apply** — Browser automation logs in and submits the generated PDF & cover letter.
