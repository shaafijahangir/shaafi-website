## 👋 Context

I built this job aggregator to streamline the process of viewing job postings on multiple different sites such as CivicJobs, BCJobs, or municipal sites. These postings are often buried across dozens of outdated portals and require repeated cover letter tailoring.

This tool centralizes job discovery, filters by location or job type, and offers AI-powered cover letter generation per listing.

## 💡 The Problem

- Public jobs (like City of Victoria roles) are **fragmented across multiple sites** (CivicJobs, municipal sites, WorkBC).
- Writing unique cover letters for each application **slows down serious applicants**.
- No unified tool exists to **track, filter, and instantly generate** tailored applications.

## ⚙️ The Solution

- **📄 Job Aggregator Dashboard**  
  Scrapes CivicJobs, BC municipal websites, and more. Users can filter by location, job type, and source. Let's take the "Parking Ambassador" as an example.

    alt="Filtered Search Results"
  />

- **🔍 Job Detail Viewer**  
  Once the posting is clicked, for example the "Parking Ambassador", it expands each listing to preview description, tags, and salary information in a readable, clean modal.

  />

- **📄 AI Cover Letter Generator**  
  When the "Cover Letter" button is clicked, Cohere and OpenAI generates a customizable cover letter based on your background and job description.

- **🛠 Tech Stack**
  - `Playwright`: Headless browser crawler normalizes jobs into a unified format
  - `Supabase`: Stores job entries, user preferences, and saved states
  - `Next.js + Tailwind`: Frontend dashboard
  - `LangChain`: Transforms job descriptions into resume bullet points
  - `Cohere` + `OpenAI`: Prompt-chained LLM pipeline to generate application material

## 🧠 Lessons Learned

- Data cleaning is crucial — scraped job data had non-standard formatting and duplicate postings.
- Prompt chaining with LangChain improved output quality significantly.
- UX matters — people prefer “one-click apply” feel even for complex jobs.

## 🔍 What’s Next

- Integrating same feature using AI to generate tailored resume
- Job status tracking (e.g., “applied”, “interviewed”)
- Deploying push notifications when new matching jobs appear
