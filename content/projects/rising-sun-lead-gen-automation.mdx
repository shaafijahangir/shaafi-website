## ðŸ§­ Project Overview

Rising Sun needed a faster way to respond to trip inquiries. Instead of manually creating itineraries, I built a simple but powerful automation pipeline using no-code and GPT.

## ðŸ§° How It Works

**1. Form Input Collection**

We collect user inputs like name, budget, trip interests, and travel dates using a simple Google Form.

**2. Make.com Automation**

Whenever a new form is submitted, Make.com watches for a new Google Sheet row. It pipes the data through GPT-4 to generate a personalized itinerary and sends the result to Gmail for delivery.

**3. Instant Email Response**

Within minutes, the customer receives a full itinerary breakdown â€” including estimated prices, local activities, and hotel suggestions. Theyâ€™re invited to edit or confirm over a phone call.

## ðŸ¤– Tech Stack

- **GPT-4 (OpenAI)** â€” Generates natural-language travel plans
- **Make.com** â€” Handles the automation logic across platforms
- **Google Sheets + Forms** â€” Stores lead inputs and triggers automation
- **Gmail** â€” Sends branded email replies with itinerary and CTA

---

## ðŸ§  Outcome

This system reduced lead response time from days to seconds. The CTA (book a call to confirm or edit) drives higher conversion, while the automation keeps things personal at scale.

## ðŸ’¡ What Iâ€™d Improve Next

- Add itinerary editing buttons inside the email
- Expand destination database with local pricing APIs
- Embed the form directly on the Rising Sun site
