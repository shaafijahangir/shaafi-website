## üëã Context & My Role

Brentwood College‚Äôs IT team handled over **400+ support tickets each month**, often repeating answers to common questions like WiFi troubleshooting, password resets, or printing issues.

I led the development of an AI-powered helpdesk chatbot designed to act as a **first line of support** for students and staff, reducing strain on the IT team and improving response times.

---

## üí° The Problem

- Over 30 disjointed systems (Meraki, JAMF, Okta, AD, etc.) created context-switching fatigue.
- Most student tickets involved repeatable fixes already documented online, but often ignored.
- Long resolution times for simple issues (e.g., "I can't print") caused delays across campus.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è The Solution

- Built a **GPT-4 chatbot** trained on internal SOPs and IT documentation.
- Integrated **vector-based search** so the bot could retrieve the most relevant answer dynamically.
- Added logic for **step-by-step walk-throughs** for common tasks (e.g., fixing "Hold for Authentication" print errors).
- Included support for multilingual queries and after-hours guidance.

## üß† Lessons Learned

- **Prompt Engineering Matters**: Early versions gave verbose answers. We refined prompts based on real logs to match Brentwood‚Äôs student-friendly tone.
- **Small Automation = Big Impact**: Even covering the top 5 ticket types saved hours weekly for staff.
- **Security & Privacy**: Kept logs anonymized and used **role-based access control** to avoid sensitive data leaks.

## üîç What‚Äôs Next

We're working on training a **local LLM** (e.g., GPT-NeoX) on years of historical tickets to:

- Auto-tag and triage incoming requests
- Predict emerging issues before they escalate
- Further reduce manual triage overhead

## ‚úÖ Takeaway

A simple chatbot, when aligned with real pain points, can become a **scalable extension of the IT team** ‚Äî especially valuable in a school environment where students need fast, friendly tech support.
