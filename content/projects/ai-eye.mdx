problem: |
  Office workers frequently **forget to hydrate** and stare at screens for hours,
  leading to eyestrain and dehydration.  
  Existing reminder apps rely on obtrusive push notifications users dismiss.

solution: |
  We built a wearable with an ESP32-CAM and on-device gesture detection that
  flashes subtle LED cues and voice reminders whenever hydration or eye-break
  targets arenâ€™t met.
